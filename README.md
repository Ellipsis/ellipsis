A framework for managing dotfiles.

Clone and symlink or use handy-dandy installer:

    curl -sL ellipsis.sh | sh

You can also specify which modules to install by setting the `MODULES` variable, i.e.:

    curl -sL ellipsis.sh | MODULES='vim zsh' sh

### Usage
```
Usage: ellipsis <command>

Commands
  new         create a new ellipsis module
  install     install a new ellipsis module
  list        list available modules
  push        push updates to local modules back to upstream repositories
  pull        pull updates from upstream repositories
  status      report status of local modules
  help        print this message and exit
  version     print ellipsis version
```

### Configuration
You can fork this repository and customize or use modules to extend your
ellipsis installation. You can list additional modules, i.e.:
`github:user/repo github:user/repo2`, etc.

### Modules
A module is any github repo with files you want to symlink into `$HOME`. You can
add an `ellipsis.sh` file which will be sourced and used to customize how
ellipsis installs/uses your module.

Behavior of a module can be customized using several hooks.

### Hooks

#### mod.install
Customize how module is installed. By default all files are symlinked into `$HOME`.

#### mod.push
Customize how how changes are pushed `ellipsis push` is used.

#### mod.pull
Customize how how changes are pulled in when `ellipsis pull` is used.

#### mod.status
Customize output of `ellipsis status`.

### API
Ellipsis exposes a number of variables to modules during install/execution as
well as a collection of useful utility functions.

#### ellipsis.platform
Platform detection, returns lowercase result of `uname`.

#### ellipsis.backup
Moves existing file `$1` to `$1.bak`, taking care not to overwrite any existing
backups.

#### ellipsis.run_installer
Download an installation script with `curl` and execute it.

#### ellipsis.link_files
Links files in `$1` into `$HOME`.

There are also several wrappers around common git operations which can be used
for consistency with the rest of ellipsis.

- `git.clone`
- `git.pull`
- `git.push`
- `git.status`
